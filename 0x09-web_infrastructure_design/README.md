# Learning Objectives
*At the end of this project, I am expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:*

# General
- You must be able to draw a diagram covering the web stack you built with the sysadmin/devops track projects
- You must be able to explain what each component is doing
- You must be able to explain system redundancy
- Know all the mentioned acronyms: LAMP, SPOF, QPS

# Basic Definitions
- What is DNS?
DNS is, in simple words, the technology that translates human-adapted, text-based domain names to machine-adapted, numerical-based IP:
- What is monitoring?
software monitoring will watch computer metrics, record them, and emit an alert if something is unusual or that could make the computer not work properly happens.
- What is web server?
A web server is a software that delivers web pages. A server is an actual computer.

- Network basics: Networking is a big part of what made computers so powerful and why the Internet exists. It allows machines to communicate with each other.
- A Load balancer: Load balancer will distribute the work-load of your system to multiple individual systems, or group of systems to to reduce the amount of load on an individual system, which in turn increases the reliability, efficiency and availability of your enterprise application or website.
- Servers: Servers are located in datacenters which are buildings that host hundreds, or even thousands of computers (servers). You can think of a server as a computer without a keyboard, mouse, or screen, that is accessible only by a network. A server can be physical or virtual. A server runs an OS (operating system).
